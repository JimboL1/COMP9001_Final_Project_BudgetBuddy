## 📝 项目描述 (按照示例格式)

**My program is a comprehensive budgeting tool designed specifically for students to manage their monthly finances effectively.**

**The program firstly allows users to set up their monthly budget using the popular 50/30/20 rule (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings) or custom percentage allocation.**

**It then provides an intuitive interface for users to log their daily expenses with categories and descriptions, tracking spending patterns over time.**

**The program uses intelligent algorithms to analyze spending behavior and provides personalized "shrink suggestions" when users exceed their budget limits, helping them develop better financial habits.**

**It also generates visual charts and reports using matplotlib to help users understand their spending patterns and make informed financial decisions.**

**All data is stored locally in CSV/JSON format ensuring complete privacy with no cloud dependencies.**
