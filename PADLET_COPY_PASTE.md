## 📝 描述 (直接复制粘贴到Padlet)

My program is a comprehensive budgeting tool designed specifically for students to manage their monthly finances effectively.

The program firstly allows users to set up their monthly budget using the popular 50/30/20 rule (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings) or custom percentage allocation.

It then provides an intuitive interface for users to log their daily expenses with categories and descriptions, tracking spending patterns over time.

The program uses intelligent algorithms to analyze spending behavior and provides personalized "shrink suggestions" when users exceed their budget limits, helping them develop better financial habits.

It also generates visual charts and reports using matplotlib to help users understand their spending patterns and make informed financial decisions.

All data is stored locally in CSV/JSON format ensuring complete privacy with no cloud dependencies.
